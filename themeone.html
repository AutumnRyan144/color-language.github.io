			<h3><br>Linguistic Relativity</h3>
			<p><img id="sapirPic" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Edward_Sapir.jpg" alt="Image of Edward Sapir in a suit and tie, circa about 1910." height="110">The theory of linguistic relativity is an interesting one: it states that your native language, the very words that come out of your mouth, affect every aspect of your life. It suggests that your thoughts, your interactions, your ideas, and everything else cognitive that you carry out in daily life is fundamentally influenced by language. Many sources attribute this idea to Edward Sapir (left) and Benjamin Lee Whorf, who did some of the primary research in the field and whose ideas were condensed into a concrete hypothesis in the 1920s. However, others point to earlier researchers, such as Hugo Magnus, and suggest that the idea emerged much earlier.</p>
