			<h3><br>Linguistic Relativity</h3>
			<p><img id="sapirPic" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Edward_Sapir.jpg" alt="Image of Edward Sapir in a suit and tie, circa about 1910." height="110">The theory of linguistic relativity is an interesting one: it states that your native language, the very words that come out of your mouth, affect every aspect of your life. It suggests that your thoughts, your interactions, your ideas, and everything else cognitive that you carry out in daily life is fundamentally influenced by language. Many sources attribute this idea to Edward Sapir (left) and Benjamin Lee Whorf, who did some of the primary research in the field and whose ideas were condensed into a concrete hypothesis - the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, sometimes called the Whorfian Hypothesis - in the 1920s. However, others point to earlier researchers, such as Hugo Magnus, and suggest that the idea emerged much earlier.</p>
			<h3><br>Hugo Magnus</h3>
			<p>Hugo Magnus was one of the pioneer researchers in the field of linguistic relativity, specifically relating it to color. Although his research provided the foundation for the Whorfian Hypothesis, he wouldn’t have agreed with it. Magnus believed that human color perception had evolved over time, and that humans had not always been able to see the full spectrum that we know today. Therefore, he suggested that language evolved in response to changes in color perception - not the other way around. One can't help but wonder whether he'd approve of his legacy.</p>
			<h3><br>Perspectives</h3>
			<p>Paul Kay and Terry Regier discuss different perspectives in this field in their article “Language, thought, and color: Recent developments.” Relativists are those who support the hypothesis, and universalists are those who do not. For a long time, these were the only two sides. However, a new argument - a combination of the two viewpoints - has recently emerged. It’s a sort of compromise; it states that focal colors, the leading argument against the hypothesis, do exist, but that language still plays a role in color perception. Currently, this is the most scientifically supported viewpoint. (See the Basic Color Terms and Focal Colors tab for more information on focal colors.)</p>
			<h3><br>Validity of the Hypothesis</h3>
			<p>As Franca Agnoli and Earl Hunt point out in “The Whorfian Hypothesis: A Cognitive Psychology Perspective”, there is valid evidence both supporting and refuting the hypothesis. This leaves many searching for different approaches to the issue. Because of this discord, many believe the Whorf Hypothesis is impossible to prove scientifically; Agnoli and Hunt suggest otherwise. They propose that nonscientific evidence - such as how naturally a thought or idea comes to someone - can be considered scientific if approached in a different way. They suggest that the “naturalness” mentioned before could count as scientific evidence if approached in a mathematical manner; if a person completes fewer computational steps to reach a conclusion, then that conclusion comes more naturally to them. <br> <br>This is just the tip of the iceberg.
