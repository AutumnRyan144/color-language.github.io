			<h3><br>...Are Caused by Language?</h3>
			<p>Color distinction has been the universal test for linguistic relativity because it’s considered to be the easiest subconscious process to observe. So, scientists often gravitate towards color-related linguistic abnormalities when designing experiments in this field. For example, Robert MacLaury took special interest in the Shuswap people of northern Canada for one reason: they have one word that refers to both yellow and green (and sometimes certain shades of blue). MacLaury hoped to discover whether they are able to distinguish colors further than their language permits. He asked Shuswap participants to arrange samples of colors into the categories considered to be basic in English (red, orange, yellow, etc.). Participants varied only slightly in their categorization, showing that despite their language’s lack of separate terms for certain colors, they are still able to easily differentiate between them. Therefore, according to this study, humans are entirely capable of distinguishing the differences in colors without unique semantic labels for them.</p>
			<p>However, a similar experiment, done by Guillaume Thierry and his fellow researchers at Bangor University, reached a different conclusion. Native speakers of Greek and English were shown a collection of different colored shapes. The first set contained mostly light blue samples with one darker variant. Participants were asked to identify the different shade, then the test was repeated with green shapes. While English speakers had relatively identical levels of ability to distinguish between shades of green and shades of blue, Greeks were able to much more quickly and easily distinguish between the blue shades than the green. Thierry and his colleagues concluded that this was because the Greek language has two different words for blue, each representing a different shade. These results differ from those of MacLaury, suggesting that native language does, in fact, have an effect on human color perception.</p>
			<h3><br>If Not Language, Then What?</h3>
			<p>Preconditions may play a role in people’s ability to distinguish between colors, according to a study conducted by Weifang Zhong, You Li, Yulan Huang, He Li, and Lei Mo. People were shown dark blue, light blue, light green, and dark green cards and asked to sort them into different categories (green and blue, light and dark, then specifically identifying each color). The colors they viewed immediately before the test and the type of categorization they were asked to do affected the time that it took them to answer. The authors thus concluded that the verbal context in which colors are described can affect a person’s ability to perceive different colors in the moment. This suggests that even if a person’s native language doesn’t affect their color perception, the specific words used when giving the task - which is language, in a sense - might.</p>
			<p>A different type of precondition, a person’s educational background, was examined in Carlisle Bynum’s “Color Memory of University Students: Influence of Color Experience and Color Characteristic.” This study determined that your background can influence your color perception. For instance, people who majored in design in college were most able to distinguish between shades of orange, whereas people who hadn’t majored in design were best able to differentiate between shades of purple.</p>
			<p><br>So, what do <em>you</em> think? Is it a combination of all of the above? Or could it be something else altogether? The next section describes the major theory in opposition to linguistic relativity.<br><br></p>
