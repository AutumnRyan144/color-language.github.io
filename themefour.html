			<p>Although this category is small, it is arguably the most important. Research in this field is pretty much at a standstill; it is an ideological topic, and without new stances or ways to approach it, a final answer would never be found.</p>
			<p>The study previously mentioned in the “Differences in Color Distinction” section that tested university students’ color perception details one such stance. The article points out that color perception isn’t all black-and-white (please excuse my pun). There is no one right answer. The article specifically refers to educational background as an underlying cause of differences in color perception, but the same idea carries to other influences. Color perception responds to a myriad of factors, only one of which may or may not be language.</p>
			<p>Barbara Saunders published an article in Anthropology of Color that details a completely new way to approach the idea. According to her, we should completely restructure the way we think about color. She states that the actual light waves hitting our eyes, although they make up vision, is only a precondition for color vision -  color cannot be categorized until it is paired with an associated word. She also suggests that we should not derive information from cross-cultural experimentation, which most executed experiments have heavily relied on, but instead draw from history and physiological theory.</p>
			<p>So, in short, there is no right answer at the moment. And finding one might mean redefining the term “color” itself.</p>
