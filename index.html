		    <h4>ABOUT CHROMACUITY</h4>
		    <p>That question at the top of the screen - "How does native language affect color perception?" - may sound absurd. Surprisingly, however, many scientists have found correlation between the language you speak and the colors you see. But just how deep does this connection go? Does language cause differences in color perception, or are they merely connected? <br><br> Major research in this field began with a controversial hypothesis in the early 1900s, which you can read more about by clicking on the box labelled "The Whorfian Hypothesis" to the right. It sparked decades of debate, some of the most notable results of which you can explore by clicking on the other boxes. Not into reading?
