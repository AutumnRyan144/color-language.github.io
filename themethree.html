			<h3><br>Definitions</h3>
			<p>Basic color terms (BCTs) - colors that every human can identify, no matter their language <br> Focal colors - standard examples of certain categories of colors</p>
			<h3><br>The World Color Survey</h3>
			<p>Scientists have struggled to scientifically describe how different languages categorize color vision because it can only be tested subjectively. Michael Webster and Paul Kay described an experiment where Brent Berlin and Kay hoped to find more solid information about color vision and perception through the use of BCTs.  They asked people across 20 languages to label colors and point out which colors were the best representation of each term. They came to the conclusion that there are 11 BCTs, and that the primary difference between languages is the number of primary color terms. The languages with the same number of primary color terms tended to have the same meaning for their color terms. If this theory is correct, then that would prove the Whorf Hypothesis incorrect. However, while many tests have backed the theory of BCTs, there are just as many others that refute it.
</p>
			<p>Focal colors are not the same as basic color terms. While BCTs are colors that can supposedly be distinguished between by every human, focal colors are the standard examples of certain categories of colors, and are present in most languages. According to Marc Bornstein’s “Hue categorization and color naming: Cognition to language to culture”, red, blue, green, and yellow are focal colors among human vision. The existence of these four focal colors is confirmed by different cultures categorizing these colors the same way, babies categorizing these colors before learning to speak, animals possessing color vision that categorize colors the same way, and consistency within brain waves from the visual centers in the brain. Bornstein also outlines three general views on color categorization: language and culture are interrelated and differences in language come from differences in culture; language and culture are interrelated but differences in culture come from differences in language; and language and culture are not related in any way.
			</p>
			<h3><br>Contradictions</h3>
			<p>Like Borstein, Paul Kay and Terry Regier split people into two general opinion categories: universalists and relativists. Universalists believe that language generally doesn’t affect color perception, and that there are certain focal colors that are more easily recognized and categorized by the human brain across all languages. Relativists believe the opposite; that there is a strong cause-effect relationship between language and color perception, and they don’t believe that focal colors exist. However, now people are starting to have a combination of the two opinions, where they believe that there are certain focal colors, but color perception is still affected by language. In other words, they believe that there are certain basic focal colors within the human mind, but argue that language can affect more detailed color perception. This new theory has had positive results from multiple tests.
</p>
			<p>“Russian ‘blues’: Controversies of basicness” describes an example that contradicts the existence of BCTs. The Russian language has two words for blue: sinij (dark blue) and goluboj (light blue). In the list of 11 BCTs identified by Berlin and Kay, there is only one term for blue; the Russian term “sinij” is listed for that one blue, although multiple studies show that Russians view sinij and goluboj as two distinct colors. However, other studies show that there is a little bit of overlap in the two color areas, and in that blurred area, people are more likely to refer to the color as sinij than goluboj. </p>
